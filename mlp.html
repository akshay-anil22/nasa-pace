      <h1>MULTI ANGULAR POLARIMETER</h1>
    </center>
    <h3>
      The Multi-Angle Polarimeter (MAP) is one of the advanced instruments
      onboard NASA’s PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) satellite.
      Its primary purpose is to measure the properties of aerosols and clouds by
      analyzing how sunlight is scattered in the atmosphere. Understanding
      aerosols and clouds is crucial for studying their impact on climate and
      air quality, as well as their interactions with each other and with
      sunlight.

      <h2>WORKING</h2>
      <h3>
        A polarimeter measures the polarization of light, which is the
        orientation of light waves as they travel. Sunlight becomes polarized
        when it interacts with particles in the atmosphere, such as aerosols
        (tiny particles like dust, smoke, and sea salt) and cloud droplets. By
        examining this polarized light from multiple angles (hence,
        “multi-angle”), the instrument can determine the size, shape,
        composition, and distribution of aerosols and cloud particles.

      <h2>Aerosol Properties</h2>
      <h3>
        Aerosols scatter sunlight in specific ways depending on their
        composition and size. The MAP captures the scattered light at different
        angles to analyze these properties, providing detailed information on
        the types of aerosols (e.g., dust, smoke, sea salt) present in the
        atmosphere.

      <h2>Cloud Properties</h2>
      <h3>
        The instrument also studies cloud particles, measuring their shape,
        size, and how they reflect sunlight. This helps to understand the role
        of clouds in reflecting or absorbing solar energy, which is critical to
        Earth's energy balance.

      <h2>Multiple Viewing Angles</h2>

      <h3>
        By observing the same spot on Earth from multiple angles, the MAP can
        provide a more complete and accurate picture of how aerosols and clouds
        scatter light, offering insights into their physical characteristics.
